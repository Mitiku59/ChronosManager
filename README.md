# ChronosManager

ChronosManager is a tool for managing time part of the Ephestos project. Its goal is to offer a similar approach to other apps using the pomodor technique but still be more flexible and powerful. To install it , you need to dowload Pharo and use the Catalog Browser for installing it inside Pharo.
